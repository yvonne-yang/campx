# Camp X
*Do you dream about going on a top-secret mission? Saving fellow agents and retrieve intel with your expertise?  
Welcome to Camp X. A mission of antidotes, scout robots, and dangerous beasts in an abandoned place.  
I hope you are sure about this, because, beware!  
Only the best of the best will survive...*  

This is a 3-level educational game made for students in middle/high school. The levels are Mission Elixir (maths and chemistry), Mission Glitch (visual programming), and Mission Darwin (biology). The instructions to each level are shown before each one. You can also pause the game any time to view them in a game menu. Your progress for each game is saved in "Spy Rankings".

## What's the story behind this project?
This was originally the culminating project of our Grade 12 Computer Science class. It was a cool project that simulated real-world teamworking. We worked as contractors for the client, our teacher, and wrote weekly/summative reports. Even as university students looking back, no other course ever taught us *this* much. Organizing program structures (with UMLs), documenting, communicating with a client, communicating amongst the team, constantly improving and reflecting--those 120 hours spent were well worth it. This experience changed both of our lives. We went on to pursue software-related degrees and still dream about making magic happen at Rayark.
